    "* So, we need to determine how many function calls the code executes given an $n \\geq 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For, $n = 1$ we know the running time is $O(1)$ since like we previously said we're only executing primitive operations one time each.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, for $n > 1$ we can draw the recursion tree, notice that with each subsequent row in the recursion tree our number of nodes or function calls doubles, and that we'll have a total of $n$ rows since the root node is the $1^{st}$ row and it takes $n - 1$ more rows to reach the leaves which gives a total of $n - 1 + 1 = n$ rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This means the total number of function calls or nodes is found by summing up the number of function calls or nodes in each row which is $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \\ldots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, we know that with each function call a certain number of primitive operations occurs which can be ignored since we ultimately care about how many times the algorithm repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So, the largest growth rate present in the algorithm is $2^n$ which means the running time in terms of Big-Oh is $O(2^n)$."
